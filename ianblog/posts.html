<p>Biology is the branch of science that studies life and living organisms. It helps us understand how plants, animals, humans, and microorganisms live, grow, and interact with their surroundings. Everything that is alive, from the smallest cell to entire ecosystems, is studied in biology. <br> <br>
One of the most important concepts in biology is the cell. Cells are the basic units of life and are often called the building blocks of all living things. Some organisms, such as bacteria, are made of only one cell, while humans and other animals are made of many cells working together. Studying cells helps scientists understand how life functions at a very basic level. <br> <br>
Biology also explains how living things get energy and survive. Plants make their own food through photosynthesis, while animals get energy by eating plants or other animals. These processes allow organisms to grow, move, and reproduce, ensuring the continuation of life on Earth. <br> <br>
Overall, biology helps us understand what life is and how it works. By learning biology, we begin to see how all living things are connected, which leads us to a bigger question: Why is biology important in our everyday lives?</p>
