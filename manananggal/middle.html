One evening, a fisherman named Mateo noticed something strange near the old banyan tree at the edge of town. He saw a faint shadow moving above the rooftops, its wings spread wide against the pale moonlight. Though his heart pounded with fear, he also felt a strong sense of responsibility to protect his village from harm. <br> <br>
Meanwhile, a young healer named Rosa discovered that salt, garlic, and ashes had been scattered near the homes of the villagers. She realized that someone had been secretly defending the town for years, following ancient traditions passed down by their ancestors. Determined to help, she worked with Mateo to strengthen the town’s defenses before the next full moon.
