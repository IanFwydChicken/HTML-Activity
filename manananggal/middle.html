One night, a thoughtful and observant young villager named Mara noticed that panic and disorder seemed to attract more strange noises from the sky. Instead of joining in the fear, she studied the patterns of the village and realized that the Manananggal appeared most when people were isolated, frightened, and divided. Determined to protect her home, Mara gathered her neighbors and encouraged them to stay together, keep their lamps burning brightly, and check on one another instead of hiding alone. She organized nightly watch groups, ensuring that no family felt abandoned. Over time, the villagers grew braver and more united, singing songs, telling stories, and lighting their paths with warm, steady flames. The once-terrifying nights became calmer, and the distant wing beats grew less frequent.</div>
