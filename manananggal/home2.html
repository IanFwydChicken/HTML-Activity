<h1>Manananggal</h1>
<p>In the vast landscape of Philippine folklore, few creatures evoke as much primal terror as the Manananggal. A ghoulish, man-eating sub-type of the aswang, this malevolent spirit is most famous for its gruesome ability to sever its torso at the waist, leaving its lower limbs behind while its upper half sprouts massive, leathery bat wings to take flight. Under the cover of darkness, it haunts the rural skies, using a long, thread-like tongue to prey upon the unsuspecting—most notably sleeping pregnant women. More than just a monster, the Manananggal serves as a chilling cultural symbol of the hidden dangers lurking in the night and the vulnerability of the home.</p> </div>
