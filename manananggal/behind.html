<div class="content-box"> <h2 class="section-title"><span class="line"></span> Behind the Legend </h2>
The legend of the Manananggal originates from Philippine folklore and tells of a terrifying creature that can separate its upper body from its lower half, sprouting enormous bat-like wings to fly through the night. It is said to prey on sleeping pregnant women, using a long, thread-like tongue to feed on unborn children or the vulnerable. The creature often appears during the full moon, lurking in remote villages or near the fields where people are alone. Villagers believed that it could be warded off with garlic, salt, or prayers, and that community vigilance could protect the homes. Beyond its frightening actions, the Manananggal legend serves as a moral tale, warning of hidden dangers, the importance of caution after dark, and the need for unity among neighbors to face threats that might be unseen.</div>
<div class="content-box"> <h2 class="section-title"><span class="line"></span> Reflection </h2> Reading and retelling the legend of the Manananggal reminded me that folklore is not just about scary creatures—it is also about the lessons we can learn from them. The story highlights the importance of courage, vigilance, and community, showing that fear loses its power when people work together. It also reflects how culture preserves values through generations, teaching younger people how to face challenges with wisdom and unity. Through this tale, I realized that even the most frightening myths can inspire strength, cooperation, and respect for our traditions. </div>
