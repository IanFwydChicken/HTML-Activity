As dawn broke over the horizon, the last echoes of the creature faded into the mountains beyond the village. The people realized that their greatest strength was not weapons or walls, but their unity, courage, and compassion for one another. Mara’s leadership became a lesson passed down through generations, reminding future villagers that fear thrives in darkness and loneliness, but fades in light and togetherness. Though the legend of the Manananggal still lingered in folklore, the village no longer lived in terror. Instead, they faced the night with confidence, knowing that as long as they stood together, they could overcome even the darkest of myths.</div>
